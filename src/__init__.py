"""
Root package for the Zimbot project.

This module serves as the main entry point for the project, maintaining
the authoritative version number, global configuration, and key project-level
constants.

Note: Core logging configuration is initialized through src/core/utils/logger.py.

# Ensure this uses the logger configuration defined in src/core/utils/logger.py
try:
    from zimbot.core.utils.logger import configure_logger  # Ensure logger setup exists

# Project-wide constants can be added here if needed
# For example, if you want to define an API timeout or other global settings,
# you could add them here, ensuring they donâ€™t conflict with core or
# module-level configs.
